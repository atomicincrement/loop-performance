//! In this section we look at the packed_simd crate and repr(SIMD)
//!
//! The original packed_simd crate was intended to develop a portable
//! model for SIMD arithmetic on Rust.
//!
//! However, the packed_simd maintainers seem to be out of touch
//! and there is a new version here: https://github.com/rust-lang/packed_simd
//! The new crate is packed_simd_2.
//!
//! This, in turn is deprecated for https://github.com/rust-lang/stdsimd
//!
